# Tree Enumeration Project

## Overview

The Tree Enumeration Project is an advanced system designed for comprehensive forest analysis using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques. The project includes functionalities such as tree count, mask detection, optimal path detection, species detection, and fire detection in forests.

## Features

- **Tree Count**: Automatically counts the number of trees in a given forest area using image processing techniques.
- **Mask Detection**: Identifies and masks trees in an image to highlight their presence and count accurately.
- **Optimal Path Detection**: Computes the optimal path through the forest, which can be useful for navigation and planning purposes.
- **Species Detection**: Detects and classifies different species of trees based on their visual characteristics.
- **Fire Detection**: Monitors and detects fire outbreaks in the forest to aid in early warning and firefighting efforts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tree_Enumeration_Project.git
   cd Tree_Enumeration_Project
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Tree Count and Mask Detection
Run the tree count and mask detection module:
sh
Copy code
python tree_count_mask_detection.py --input images/forest.jpg --output results/masked_forest.jpg
Optimal Path Detection
Run the optimal path detection module:
sh
Copy code
python optimal_path_detection.py --input maps/forest_map.jpg --start 0,0 --end 10,10 --output results/optimal_path.jpg
Species Detection
Run the species detection module:
sh
Copy code
python species_detection.py --input images/forest.jpg --output results/species_detected.jpg
Fire Detection
Run the fire detection module:
sh
Copy code
python fire_detection.py --input images/forest.jpg --output results/fire_detected.jpg
