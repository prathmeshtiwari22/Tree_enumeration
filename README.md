# Tree Enumeration Project

## Overview

The Tree Enumeration Project is an advanced system designed for comprehensive forest analysis using state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques. The project includes functionalities such as tree count, mask detection, optimal path detection, species detection, and fire detection in forests.

## Features

- **Tree Count**: Automatically counts the number of trees in a given forest area using image processing techniques.
- **Mask Detection**: Identifies and masks trees in an image to highlight their presence and count accurately.
- **Optimal Path Detection**: Computes the optimal path through the forest, which can be useful for navigation and planning purposes.
- **Species Detection**: Detects and classifies different species of trees based on their visual characteristics.
- **Fire Detection**: Monitors and detects fire outbreaks in the forest to aid in early warning and firefighting efforts.

## Installation
